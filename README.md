# CME_GROUP

When:
During the summer of 2021 at my internship with Scout Energy Partners

Task:
Help take table information from CME Group website and extract it to CSV

Process:
I used the selenium webdriver to access the CME GROUP website on chrome. Then I clicked through multiple buttons to load all of the table information. I used BeautifulSoup to parse the information and to help find the table. Once I found the table. I put the information in a pandas dataframe. From there, I exported the information to a csv file.

By doing this, I was able to get into the basics of web parsing and website interaction. I was able to learn a little bit more about HTML and how to extract the valuable information from websites.
